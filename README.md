🛍️ E-Commerce Sales Dashboard
📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to identify best-selling products, key sales trends, and high-performing categories using Power BI.
The goal was to transform raw sales data into a clear, interactive dashboard that enables data-driven decision-making.

✅ What I Did

✅ Cleaned and organized raw e-commerce data for analysis.

✅ Built interactive visuals showing sales by category, product, month, and region.

✅ Designed a structured Power BI dashboard for easy navigation and storytelling.

✅ Highlighted patterns in sales performance and identified top revenue drivers.

💡 Insights

✅ Category Performance: Certain product categories consistently outperformed others, indicating strong consumer preference.

✅ Seasonal Trends: Monthly analysis revealed periods of peak sales, suggesting opportunities for targeted marketing during high-demand months.

✅ Regional Breakdown: Some regions generated higher revenue, pointing to potential expansion or inventory prioritization in those areas.

✅ Top Products: A small group of products contributed a large portion of total sales — a classic case of the 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle).

🧭 Recommendations

✅ Focus marketing efforts on high-performing categories and regions to maximize ROI.

✅ Optimize inventory around best-selling products and high-demand months.

✅ Investigate low-performing regions/categories to understand barriers and improve outreach.

✅ Introduce data-driven pricing and promotions during peak sales periods to boost revenue further.
